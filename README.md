# Customer Churn Prediction Dashboard

## Overview
This project delivers a business-focused, machine learning–powered dashboard for predicting customer churn, segmenting users by risk, and driving data-backed retention strategies. Using XGBoost and other classification models, we achieve highly accurate predictions and build actionable recommendations for business stakeholders.

## Repo Structure
- `data/` — datasets for preprocessing and modeling (include sample, not sensitive full data if private)
- `notebooks/` — Google collab notebooks and/or scripts for all steps
- `dashboard/` — Dashboard screenshots (.jpg/.png), final analytics reports (.pdf), Power BI file (.pbix)
- `reports/` — Business summary/report (PDF/PPTX)

## Key Results
- Churn rate: ~67%
- Top model: XGBoost (Accuracy, ROC AUC, Precision, Recall, F1 = 1.00)
- Business segmentation: Models enable customer-level churn risk scoring for targeted retention
- Most at-risk segments: Young users (12–20), free plan subscribers

Dashboard Preview
- Executive Summary: Key KPIs (total users, churn rate, best model accuracy)
- Demographics & Segmentation: Pie/bar charts for age, gender, subscription, churn segmentation
- Model Performance & Predictions: Confusion matrix, probability histogram, actual-vs-predicted, model metrics
- Business Insights & Recommendations: Actionable guidance and business value statements
  
## Business Recommendations
- Target high-risk segments with retention offers
- Automate CRM alerts for at-risk users
- Enhance onboarding for new and at-risk segments

## How to Reproduce / Use
1. Download data from `data/` (or specify how to get data)
2. Run notebooks step-by-step or open final Power BI dashboard
